In this experiment, I learned how to use blocks on the microbit program to code push switches .

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as turning on a laptop and seeing the homescreen displayed.

### 2. using a light sensor and analog imputs ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment I learned how to use a phototransistor as a sensor, perform an analog reading via imput pin P0, and set a light threshold to decide the display.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as the light meter in a digital camera which changes the shutterspeed depending on how much light is present.

### 3.dimming an LED using a poteniometer ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment I learned  how to use a push switch to turn an external LED on, use a potentiometer as a dividernand to ascertain the analog reading, as well as use it to set the brightness of the external LED.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a light switch with a dimming function.

### 4. Using a transistor to drive a motor ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment I learned how to use a transistor to drive a fan motor, and to control the speed of the motor using pulse width modulation (PWM).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as transistors in hearing aids.

### 5. Using the accelerometer to control motor speed ###

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment I learnt how to use an accelerometer and PWM to control the speed of a fan motor by tilting the micro:bit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a dynamic accelerometer which measures the gravitational pull to determine the angle at which a device is tilted with respect to the Earth.
